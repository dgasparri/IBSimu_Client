# IBSimu Client

IBSimu Client is a client application for the [IBSimu Ion Beam Simulator](http://ibsimu.sourceforge.net/) library for plasma simulation. It is designed to run on both Windows and Linux.

It was developed because I was tired of recompiling the code every time I wanted to change a parameter (geometries, boundary conditions, beam composition)


The client is just a convenient way to:
* change simulation parameters (geometries, boundary conditions, beam composition) without recompiling the code
* run reasonably sized simulations
* collect beam data during the simulation, including Twiss parameters and convergence
* visualize the results of previous simulations


# Documentation

IBSimu Client has a [documentation site](https://dgasparri.github.io/IBSimu_Client/) with an installationg guide, examples on how to use the package and references to its commands and parameters.
